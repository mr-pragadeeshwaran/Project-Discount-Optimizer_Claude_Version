"""
weekly_tracker.py — the weekly discount-tracker ORCHESTRATOR.

Each week: read the latest model plan (per SKU x city cell), turn it into a
guarded, gliding weekly price recommendation, score last week's predictions
against what actually happened, and refresh the master Excel tracker + a
plain-English readout.

Flow:
  1. Load the model's per-cell plan (output/runs/<run>/plan/all_cells.csv).
  2. Build the standard `plan_df` (contract columns).
  3. apply_seasonality  → flag festival weeks, relax budget, exclude from scoring.
  4. apply_guardrail    → glide (<=3ppt), revenue-protect, enforce budget cap.
  5. Append this week's PREDICTIONS to tracker_history.csv; fill ACTUALS for any
     prior week now present in the fresh export (matched by cell_id + week).
  6. score_history      → running predicted-vs-actual accuracy (the trust engine).
  7. build_workbook     → DISCOUNT_PLAN/WEEKLY_TRACKER.xlsx.
  8. Write WEEKLY_READOUT.md — the plain-English "what to change and why".

Usage:
  python -X utf8 scripts/tracker/weekly_tracker.py --week W1 --date 2026-07-06
  (with no args it uses the latest model run and today-ish as the week.)
