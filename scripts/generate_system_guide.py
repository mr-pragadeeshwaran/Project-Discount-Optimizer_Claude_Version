generate_system_guide.py — build DISCOUNT_OPTIMIZER_SYSTEM_GUIDE.pdf

One self-contained, business-owner-friendly PDF: the entire workflow with
diagrams, the logic of every stage in plain language, the proof layer, and a
structured guide to reading every output. Regenerate any time the system
changes:  python -X utf8 scripts/generate_system_guide.py

NOTE ON CHARACTERS: the built-in PDF fonts (Helvetica/WinAnsi) have no glyphs
for the rupee sign, arrows, checkmarks or Greek letters — so this document uses
"Rs.", drawn arrow shapes, "phi"/"kappa" spelled out, etc. Do not "fix" that.
