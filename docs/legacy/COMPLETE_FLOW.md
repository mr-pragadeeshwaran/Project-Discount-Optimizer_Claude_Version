## 1. The business question

For 4 SKUs of 24 Mantra Organic on Blinkit, across 11 cities (33 active
SKU × city "cells"):

> **"For each cell, what selling price should I put on Blinkit each week
> for the next 3 months — to reduce wasted discount where customers won't
> notice and reinvest in cities where deeper discount actually drives
> volume?"**

The system delivers a weekly Excel report the brand team reads Monday
morning and acts on.

## 3. The journey of ONE cell

To make this concrete, follow Jaggery Powder 500g × Delhi-NCR through
the entire system using real numbers from the current run.

### Starting state — what the data file contained
- 350+ daily rows of sales over the past year
- Average selling price recently: ₹70.6 (current discount 21.6%)
- Average daily units: ~30
- MRP on Blinkit: ₹90
- Discount has varied from 6% to 35% over the year

### Where it ends up — what the report says

> **Delhi-NCR — Jaggery 500g**
> - Confidence: **Medium**, Cell R²: **0.87**, 108 days of data
> - Current price: **₹70.6** (21.6% off)
> - Target price: **₹79.0** (12.2% off — the cell's historical floor)
> - Action: **CUT** discount over 4 weeks
> - Save: **₹41,801/month** once at target
> - Plan: Week 1 → ₹73.3 → Week 2 → ₹76.0 → Week 3 → ₹78.7 → Week 4+ → **₹79.0** (stable)

This whole journey is what the next sections explain.

## 4. Stage-by-stage with worked examples

### Stage 1 — Ingest

**File:** `stage1_ingestion/ingest.py`

Reads every `.xlsx` in `input_data/`, combines them, deduplicates by
(product, city, date), filters to own-brand rows (24 Mantra Organic
patterns), and loads the event calendar.

```
Inputs:  3 Excel files (73,416 raw rows)
Output:  13,646 own-brand daily rows × 37 cells
```

For our worked-example cell (Jaggery 500g × Delhi-NCR), Stage 1 picked
out ~350 rows from the full file.

### Stage 2 — Prepare

**File:** `stage2_preparation/prepare.py`

Three jobs:

1. **Compute `stable_mrp`** (the 90th percentile of MRP per SKU — the
   "label price" that doesn't wobble daily). For Jaggery 500g: **₹90**.
2. **Compute `selling_price`** = `stable_mrp × (1 − discount/100)`.
3. **Flag day types**:
   - `is_oos_day` — availability < 50%
   - `is_event_day` — within ±2 days of a festival or platform sale
   - **`is_outlier`** — per-cell `|z-score| > 2` on log(units). Audit-trailed
     to `outliers_removed.csv`. Removes 280 of 13,646 rows this run.
   - `is_regular_day` = NOT event AND NOT OOS AND NOT outlier — only
     these go to model training.

**Worked example — outlier detection for Delhi-NCR Jaggery:**

```
Cell mean log(units) = 3.40,  std = 0.55
  Day with units=120 → log = 4.79  → z = +2.53  ❌ flagged (HIGH spike)
  Day with units=2   → log = 0.69  → z = −4.93  ❌ flagged (LOW dip)
  Day with units=28  → log = 3.33  → z = −0.13  ✓ kept
```

The flagged days might be: an undeclared promo we missed (HIGH), a
half-day stockout the 50% OSA filter didn't catch (LOW). Both would
distort the elasticity if left in.

### Stage 3 — Features

**File:** `stage3_features/features.py`

Engineers ~20 columns used downstream:

| Feature | Formula | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `log_price` | `ln(selling_price)` | Coefficient = price elasticity |
| `discount_pct` | as given | Used to compute `badge_resid` in Stage 4 |
| `osa_rolling_7d` | 7-day avg of availability | Supply control |
| `log_ad_sov` | `ln(1 + 7-day rolling ad SoV)` | Ad intensity control |
| `rpi` | `selling_price / competitor_price` | Competitive position |
| `is_weekend`, `month_2..12` | dummies | Seasonality |

### Stage 4 — The model (the brain)

**File:** `stage4_model/elasticity.py`

This is where the elasticity per cell is learned. Three big design choices:

```
For each category (Jaggery, Moong Dal, Sunflower Oil):

   Fit one Huber-robust regression on the last 180 days of regular days:

      log(units) = α_cell                              ← cell intercepts
                 + β_price · log(selling_price)        ← price elasticity
                 + β_badge · badge_resid               ← deal-badge effect
                 + controls (osa, ad, rpi, weekend, months)
```

Three things make this work:

1. **Per-category models.** Pooling Jaggery + Dal + Oil into one model
   inflated elasticity to −5.9. Separate models give plausible values
   (−0.5 to −3.6).
2. **Cell fixed effects** (`α_cell`). Identifies the slope from
   within-cell price moves only, not from cross-cell differences in
   absolute price.
3. **Decorrelated badge.** `badge_resid = discount_pct − OLS(discount ~
   log_price)` per cell. Removes the multicollinearity that was
   scrambling the elasticity coefficient.

Plus the **180-day lookback** (set via `TRAIN_LOOKBACK_DAYS = 180`):
training only on recent steady-state data avoids the Moong Dal launch
ramp and old price regimes that were poisoning the fit. This is the
single biggest accuracy lever — moved the model from "Weak" to "Strong".

#### Per-cell elasticity output

After fitting the per-category coefficient, each cell gets its own
elasticity via per-cell OLS shrunk toward the category median:

```
final_elasticity_cell = w · per_cell_OLS + (1 − w) · category_median_OLS
                        where w = n_train / (n_train + 60)
```

Clipped to `[−4, −0.3]` (plausible CPG range).

#### Stage 4 also computes for each cell:

- **`price_elasticity`** — the per-cell slope (e.g. −0.73 for Jaggery)
- **`cell_train_r2`** — the model's fit on this cell's training data,
  measured at the 3-ppt discount-bin grain (see §6)
- **`historical_floor_disc`** — the cell's lower-quartile discount in
  the last 90 days. That's the **proven-safe target** for Stage 7.
- **`n_observations`** — sample size

#### Diagnostics (current run)

```
Train log-R²: 0.887  (in-distribution fit)
Test  log-R²: 0.844  (out-of-distribution, last 20% of dates)
Raw daily MAPE: 40.1%
Aggregated (3-ppt bin) MAPE: 24.0%
Aggregated R²(units):       0.928
Accuracy tier:              STRONG  (R² ≥ 0.70 AND MAPE ≤ 25%)
```

### Stage 5 — Saturation curves

For each cell, sweep discount from 0% to 30% in 1% steps and predict
units at each level using the dual-signal model:

```
units(d) = current_units × (price(d) / current_price) ^ elasticity
                         × exp(badge_sensitivity × (d − current_discount))
```

Each cell also gets a **confidence tier** assigned at this stage:

- **High** — ≥200 obs, ≥10 distinct discount levels, ≥3 ppt std, elasticity not at boundary
- **Medium** — ≥100 obs, ≥5 levels, ≥2 ppt std
- **Low** — anything else with enough data
- **Needs Experiment** — too thin, run a price test before acting

Downgrades:
- Cell elasticity hits the −4 floor or −0.3 ceiling → demote one tier
- Cell demand grew ≥ 2× over the period (launch ramp) → demote one tier

### Stage 6 — Economics

**File:** `stage6_economics/economics.py`

For each cell, build a margin ladder:

```
For each discount level 0..30%:
  selling_price   = MRP × (1 − d/100)
  variable_cost   = 50%·MRP + 15%·selling_price + Rs.10   (COGS + commission + fulfil)
  contribution    = (selling_price − variable_cost) × predicted_units
  marginal_ROI    = Δcontribution / Δdiscount_cost (vs previous discount)
```

The **elbow** is the first discount level where marginal ROI drops
below 1.0 — adding more discount stops paying its way. With current
cost structure the elbow lands at 0% discount (pure margin says "no
discount") for most cells.

### Stage 7 — Guardrails + this-week action

**File:** `stage7_guardrails/guardrails.py`

For each cell, decide TWO things: the target and the per-cycle step.

#### Target

```
if cell qualifies for strategic reinvest:
    target = current_disc + 3 ppt          (drop price to grow volume)
else:
    target = max(elbow_disc, historical_floor_disc)
    # Default behaviour with USE_HISTORICAL_FLOOR_TARGET=True
    # → never plan a price the cell hasn't operated at recently
```

For our Delhi-NCR example: `target = max(0%, 12.2%) = 12.2%` (= ₹79.0 price).

#### Is it worth discounting? (the inelastic gate)

Before a cell can qualify for a reinvest (deeper-discount) move, it must
clear an **inelasticity gate**. Cells with `|elasticity| ≤
INELASTIC_ELASTICITY_THRESHOLD` (default 1.0) are flagged `is_inelastic`
and read as **"unlikely to pay — hold/raise"** (not "can't pay" — we only
have observational evidence the cut is *unlikely* to move enough volume to
profit). These cells are screened out of the Price Drops list and surfaced
on the Leakage sheet.

The reinvest qualification also now nets out **leakage**: the volume lift
behind the gate uses `net = gross × true_incremental_frac` (REAL new demand
only — see §7 Sheet 4), so a cell whose "growth" is mostly borrowed
(pull-forward) or stolen (sibling cannibalization) no longer qualifies, and
the headline shown to the brand is the net number, not the gross.

#### Per-cycle step (the glide rule)

```
gap = |current_disc − target_disc|

if gap < 0.1:                  step = 0     (already done)
elif gap ≤ MIN (3 ppt):        step = gap   (one-shot — don't overshoot)
else:                           step = max(MIN, gap / TARGET_TIMELINE_WEEKS)
                                # No upper cap. TIMELINE is the deadline.
```

For Delhi-NCR: gap = 9.4 ppt > 3, so `step = max(3, 9.4/12) = 3 ppt/week`.
Cycles to close: `ceil(9.4/3) = 4`.

Phasing plan: `21.6% → 18.6% → 15.6% → 12.6% → 12.2%` (4 weekly steps).

#### Tier assignment (this-cycle action gate)

```
if confidence == "Needs Experiment":             → Do Not Act
elif |gap| ≤ 2 ppt:                              → Hold
elif gap < −2 ppt (elbow above current):         → Increase (rare)
elif this_cycle_savings ≥ Rs.5K
     AND |this_cycle_vol_drop| ≤ 8%
     AND confidence ∈ {High, Medium}:            → Strong Cut
elif this_cycle_savings > 0
     AND |this_cycle_vol_drop| ≤ 20%:            → Trade-off
else:                                             → Hold
```

For Delhi-NCR: Cut, Medium confidence → **Trade-off** tier (Strong Cut
needs savings ≥ ₹5K AND vol-drop ≤ 8% — this cell hits ≥ ₹5K but the
3-ppt move predicts a slightly larger vol-drop).

```

### Why historical floor as target (and not 0%)

The pure margin-optimal elbow lives at 0% discount for almost every
cell. But pushing every cell to 0% would:

- Send some prices to MRP — a level customers haven't seen
- Risk huge volume loss in elastic markets
- Be impossible to defend ("0% off? customers will leave")

The historical floor — the cell's lower quartile of past discounts in
the last 90 days — is by construction **proven safe**: the cell has
operated at or below it on ~25% of days with healthy sales.

For Delhi-NCR Jaggery: historical floor = 12.2% off (₹79.0). The cell
has been at-or-below that on 25%+ of recent days, so returning to it
is a safe move.

---

## 6. The accuracy story

Two layers of "is this trustworthy?":

### Portfolio level (Summary sheet)

The honest headline is the **price-engine** accuracy — the price/badge curve
that *actually sets prices*, measured on held-out data WITHOUT the lag /
momentum features:

```
Price-engine held-out R²:       ~0.87   ← the number that governs recommendations
Price-engine avg error (bin):   ~26%
Accuracy tier:                  MODERATE (bin MAPE just over the 25% "Strong" bar)

(context only — NOT what sets prices:)
Full statistical model R²:      ~0.88   ← also uses recent-sales momentum/seasonality,
                                          so it scores higher, but that extra fit does
                                          not drive a single price decision
```

Why two numbers: the full regression includes lag features that predict
today's units largely from *recent* units (autocorrelation), inflating R².
Stage 5 throws those away and prices off the elasticity curve alone — so we
quote the curve's accuracy. The tier formula is editable in the Excel cell.
For the standalone audit see
[scripts/diagnostics/model_credibility_report.py](../scripts/diagnostics/model_credibility_report.py)
and the forward-validation receipts in
[scripts/diagnostics/proof_loop.py](../scripts/diagnostics/proof_loop.py)
(also surfaced as the **Track Record** sheet in the weekly Excel).

- **Recovery test (synthetic).**
  [scripts/diagnostics/recovery_test.py](../scripts/diagnostics/recovery_test.py)
  plants a *known* elasticity into fake sales data — complete with the exact
  endogeneity trap (discounts co-timed with ad flights) that biases a naive
  fit — and checks the pipeline recovers it. It does, landing ~3.7× closer to
  the planted truth than the naive estimate. Honest caveat: a small (~0.2)
  residual over-estimate remains, and it's reported in the output, not hidden.
  This proves the *machinery* works on a controlled case; it's a complement to
  the real-data R²/MAPE above, not a substitute.

### Per-city level (By Product sheet)

Each row in the city table carries 3 confidence signals:

| Signal | What it is | Read it as |
|---|---|---|
| **Conf** | Stage 5 verdict (High / Medium / Low / Needs Test) | Categorical — easy to scan |
| **Cell R²** | The model's **in-sample** fit on this cell's 3-ppt-bin grain (NOT held-out) | Numerical — how well price/qty is captured for this city; treat as a fit signal, not out-of-sample proof |
| **Obs** | Number of training days for this cell | Sample size |

### Why Cell R² is measured at the 3-ppt-bin grain (not daily)

CPG day-to-day data has irreducible noise (weather, weekday, neighbour
effects). Daily R² for a small cell can be 0.05-0.30 even with a
perfect price-effect model — because most daily variance isn't from
price.

The recommendation logic doesn't use daily predictions. It uses **mean
units per 3-ppt discount bin** (the saturation curve). So Cell R² is
computed at exactly that grain. Switching from daily to bin-grain took
city R² values from 0.08-0.65 to 0.30-0.91 — same model, same
predictions, more honest metric.

| City (Jaggery 500g) | Daily R² (old) | Aggregated R² (current) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Kolkata | 0.23 | **0.41** |
| Bangalore | 0.27 | **0.75** |
| Hyderabad | 0.35 | **0.81** |
| Mumbai | 0.28 | **0.88** |
| Others | 0.65 | **0.91** |

A few cells still show low R² (e.g. Lucknow Sunflower Oil = −0.5).
Those are now **real** confidence flags — the model genuinely can't
separate price effect from other factors there. Action: run a price
test in that city before acting.

### Sheet 3 — Track Record (the receipts)

The proof the engine works, in two parts:

- **A. Out-of-time backtest** — the model is trained on data up to a cutoff,
  then graded on the weeks *after* it (a window it never saw). Shows forward
  forecast accuracy and, crucially, the **discount-move validation**: when
  price actually moved, did volume respond as predicted? Current verdict:
  *direction correct and conservative* — raising price lost less volume than
  the model warned, so the volume risk behind a cut is, if anything, overstated.
  (Observational — these were the brand's own past price moves, not a
  controlled/randomised test; a live price test or Part B closes that gap.)
- **B. Live results** — predicted vs. actual ₹ saved per city, which
  populate once you act on a recommendation and a fresh week of data arrives.

Powered by [track_record.py](../stage8_output/track_record.py); the same
logic runs standalone via
[proof_loop.py](../scripts/diagnostics/proof_loop.py).

### Sheet 4 — Leakage (where promo lift really comes from)

Not every unit a promo "adds" is genuinely new. This sheet decomposes
each cell's promo uplift into three buckets, **purely from units** (no
COGS / margin assumptions):

- **REAL** — genuinely incremental demand.
- **BORROWED** — pull-forward `φ`: a dip *below* baseline in the weeks
  *after* a promo (customers stockpiled, so they buy less later).
- **STOLEN** — cannibalization `κ`: a dip in sibling packs *during* the
  promo (the deal pulled buyers off another SKU, not into the category).

The headline per cell is `true_incremental_frac = clip(1 − φ − κ, 0, 1)`.
These are **observational proxies, not proven causation** — read them as
"≈", "consistent with", a "directional signal", not a controlled
measurement. Each cell carries a `leakage_confidence` flag
(`no_promo` / `always_promo` / `no_variation` / `low` / `medium` /
`high`, with `_no_siblings` / `_over_attributed` suffixes) so you know how
much to trust the split.

The sheet also surfaces the **inelastic gate**: cells with
`|elasticity| ≤ 1` are flagged `is_inelastic` — *"unlikely to pay —
hold/raise"* — because a deeper cut there is unlikely to move enough
volume to profit (and these are screened out of Price Drops).

On 24 Mantra the read so far: most staples are low-leakage, while
**Sunflower Oil 1L** shows ~13–18% pull-forward — consistent with
stockpiling on the bigger pack.

### Sheet 5 — By Product (the workhorse)

For each of the 4 SKUs:

1. **Product title** (bold)
2. **Mini-summary in cells**: MRP / today gross / today discount / disc% / cities (cut/invest/hold)
3. **Model accuracy bar in cells**: Strong / Test R² 0.84 / MAPE 24%
4. **City × week table** — the operational heart:

```

### Sheets 6, 7, 8 — Price Lifts / Price Drops / Needs Test

Standalone lists for bulk-loading into Blinkit:
- **Price Lifts** — all cuts, sorted by ₹ wasted/mo
- **Price Drops** — strategic reinvestments. The volume lift here is now
  **net of leakage** (`gross_volume_lift_pct` shown alongside the headline
  `net_volume_lift_pct`, which equals `volume_lift_pct`), and inelastic
  (`|ε| ≤ 1`) cells are screened out — so the brand isn't shown a "growth"
  number that's mostly borrowed or stolen.
- **Needs Test** — Low-confidence cells that should get a pilot first

       ▼  Stage 3: engineer log_price, badge_resid, controls
       │
       ▼  Stage 4: train per-category Huber model on last 180 days
       │  - Jaggery category coefficient on log_price = −1.19
       │  - Per-cell shrunk elasticity = −0.81
       │  - Cell R² (3-ppt-bin grain) = 0.87
       │  - Historical floor (P25 of last 90 days) = 12.2%
       │  - Confidence tier = Medium (n=108, several discount levels tested)
       │
       ▼  Stage 5: build saturation curve 0%..30%
       │  Predicted daily units at each discount level
       │
       ▼  Stage 6: variable cost ladder
       │  - VC at price 70.6 = 50%·90 + 15%·70.6 + 10 = Rs.65.6
       │  - Margin/unit at 21.6% off = Rs.5.0
       │  - Margin/unit at 12.2% off = Rs.13.4   ← much higher
       │  - Elbow lands at 0% (margin-optimal)
       │
       ▼  Stage 7: targets and step
       │  - Target = max(elbow=0%, floor=12.2%) = 12.2%   ← FLOOR wins
       │  - Gap = 21.6 − 12.2 = 9.4 ppt
       │  - Step = max(3, 9.4/12) = 3 ppt/week
       │  - Cycles = ceil(9.4 / 3) = 4 weeks
       │  - Phasing: 21.6% → 18.6% → 15.6% → 12.6% → 12.2%
       │  - This-week savings: 3% · 90 · 30 · 30 = Rs.2,430 (one cell, one cycle)
       │  - Cumulative savings at target: Rs.41,801/mo
       │  - Tier: TRADE-OFF (Cell R² medium, gap moderate)
       │
       ▼  Stage 8: write to Excel report
          - Summary sheet shows portfolio impact
          - By Product sheet shows Delhi-NCR row:
              City: Delhi-NCR | Conf: Medium | Cell R²: 0.87 | Obs: 108
              Cur Rs: 70.6 | Tgt Rs: 79.0 | Action: CUT | Save Rs/mo: 41,801
              W1: 73.3 | W2: 76.0 | W3: 78.7 | W4..W12: 79.0
          - Glide Path sheet shows the cell's contribution to portfolio glide

ACTION (Monday morning)
   Brand team opens Excel → By Product → Jaggery 500g
   → Delhi-NCR row → set Blinkit price to Rs.73.3 this week

## 10. FAQ

**Q: Why does the Glide Path stop at Week 4 even though the budget is 12 weeks?**
Because most cell gaps are small (2-5 ppt). At a 3-ppt minimum step, those gaps close in 1-2 cycles. The 12-week budget is a ceiling, not a target.

**Q: Why isn't the portfolio reaching the 9% target?**
Per-cell floors are 12-22% (the historical safe levels). The weighted-average minimum the portfolio can hit without violating "never go below proven safe" is ~22%. To go further, either lower `HISTORICAL_FLOOR_PERCENTILE`, or run price tests on the Needs-Test cells to discover their true floor.

**Q: What if a cell's Cell R² is negative?**
The model is fitting that cell worse than just predicting its mean. It might be in a launch ramp, have data quality issues, or be subject to factors the model doesn't see. Action: don't auto-act, run a small price test in that city.

**Q: How does the system handle "Increase" cells (where deeper discount would help)?**
Two paths: (1) Stage 7 detects cells where elbow > current and tiers them as `Increase`. Rare under current cost structure. (2) Stage 8 separately identifies **strategic reinvest** candidates — high-elasticity cells with positive net economic impact at +3 ppt. These are the Q2 "Price Drops" list.

**Q: What if the brand team disagrees with the model?**
Open the Data sheet (hidden), edit any cell's discount manually, watch the Summary and By Product sheets recompute via formulas. Or change `TARGET_TIMELINE_WEEKS` / `MIN_DISCOUNT_CHANGE_PPT` and re-run the pipeline to get a different plan.

**Q: How do I add a new SKU or city?**
Just drop a new .xlsx into `input_data/` with the same column structure. Stage 1 picks it up automatically. The model retrains and the report includes it next run.

**Q: How often should the pipeline run?**
Weekly. Each run re-reads fresh data, re-fits the model on the last 180 days, and re-plans. The plan is **self-correcting** — if last week's recommendation produced an unexpected response, this week's elasticities adjust accordingly.

### Diagnostic / credibility scripts

Standalone audits the model has to survive before you trust the report:

- [scripts/diagnostics/model_credibility_report.py](../scripts/diagnostics/model_credibility_report.py)
  → `v4_outputs/_credibility/` — decision-vs-full accuracy, confidence
  calibration, and an omitted-variable bias probe.
- [scripts/diagnostics/proof_loop.py](../scripts/diagnostics/proof_loop.py)
  → `v4_outputs/_proof_loop/` — the out-of-time backtest + discount-move
  validation behind the Track Record sheet.
- [scripts/diagnostics/recovery_test.py](../scripts/diagnostics/recovery_test.py)
  → `v4_outputs/_recovery/` — plants a known elasticity in synthetic data and
  checks the pipeline recovers it (see §6).
