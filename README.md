# Stat IQ Lab — Optimal Price Finder

Discount optimisation for quick-commerce. Turns a CPG brand's raw sales export
into an honest, week-by-week discount plan: **which discounts are wasted, which
actually drive sales, how much you can safely save, and proof — on your own
register — that the calls were right.**

Brand-agnostic by design: the client brand, platform and every knob live in
`config/settings.csv` (edited from the dashboard's Inputs & Settings page),
never in code. Current engagement: **24 Mantra Organic on Blinkit** (6 months,
~84 products × 11 cities). Works for any brand × platform with daily sales data.

---

## Bottom line (current run)

- **Model accuracy: out-of-sample R² = 0.78** — it predicts weeks it never saw.
- **Recoverable discount waste: ~₹5–7 lakh/month**, concentrated in inelastic
  **staples** (Dal, Rice, Sooji, Millet) where discount does not move volume once
  availability, visibility and competition are controlled for.
- **Reinvest**, don't just cut: Oil is the one category where discount reliably
  *pays* — shift budget there.
- **Honest caveat:** this is a *model-validated* number (confounder-controlled +
  Double ML), **not yet register-proven.** The weekly tracker turns it into proof.
  Full verdict: [`DISCOUNT_PLAN/5L_VERDICT.md`](DISCOUNT_PLAN/5L_VERDICT.md).

## How it works (the flow)

```
  raw RCA exports (input_data/)
        │
        ▼   pipeline.py  — stages 1–3
  fact_table.csv           cleaned daily panel: units, price, discount,
  (v4_outputs/<run>/)      OSA, Ad SOV, competitive share, per SKU×city
        │
        ▼   scripts/analysis/  — the decision layer
  confounder-controlled + Double-ML model
    • isolates discount's effect from OSA / SOV / competition (+ reverse-causality lags)
    • cuts ONLY where discount is reliably below break-even
    • DISCOUNT_PLAN/  (PLAN.md, 5L_VERDICT.md, cut_list.csv, reinvest_list.csv, …)
        │
        ▼   scripts/tracker/  — the weekly loop
  WEEKLY_TRACKER.xlsx        guardrailed, gliding weekly price suggestions +
                             a predicted-vs-actual accuracy scorecard (the trust engine)
```

The **pipeline** (stages 1–8) is the data-prep + original per-cell tiering engine.
The **analysis** layer (`scripts/analysis/`) is the newer, rigorously-validated
decision model built on top of `fact_table.csv`. The **tracker** (`scripts/tracker/`)
is what you run every week.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Build the cleaned panel + base outputs from the raw exports in input_data/
python -X utf8 pipeline.py

# 2. Run the confounder-controlled + Double-ML decision model
python -X utf8 scripts/analysis/discount_plan.py     # -> v4_outputs/<run>/plan/
python -X utf8 scripts/analysis/dml_estimate.py      # Double-ML confirmation
python -X utf8 scripts/analysis/validate_plan.py     # C1–C8 acceptance checks
python -X utf8 scripts/analysis/build_report.py      # -> DISCOUNT_PLAN/*.md

# 3. Produce this week's tracker + plain-English readout
python -X utf8 scripts/tracker/weekly_tracker.py --week W1 --date 2026-07-06
# -> DISCOUNT_PLAN/WEEKLY_TRACKER.xlsx  +  DISCOUNT_PLAN/WEEKLY_READOUT.md
```

`run.bat` double-clicks the pipeline for non-technical users.

## The weekly loop

1. Export the week's sales data (same RCA format as `input_data/`).
2. Run `weekly_tracker.py` (or send the export to be run for you).
3. Open **`WEEKLY_TRACKER.xlsx`**:
   - **Weekly Plan** — per SKU×city: current vs suggested price, action, one-line reason.
   - **Guardrail** — red/green budget check (discount stays inside its % of sales,
     moves ≤3 points/week, never a cut that costs net revenue).
   - **Accuracy Scorecard** — predicted vs actual, week by week. *This is the receipt.*
   - **Seasonality** — festival calendar; the budget auto-relaxes on flagged weeks.
   - **How to use** — plain-English steps.
4. **Golden rule:** if a cut loses sales for 2 straight weeks, revert it.

## Honest notes

- The savings figure is **model-validated, not yet register-proven.** The scorecard
  fills in from week 2 and converts the estimate into evidence.
- **Two data gaps** would materially tighten it (see [`DISCOUNT_PLAN/DATA_GAPS.md`](DISCOUNT_PLAN/DATA_GAPS.md)):
  the `Competitor Price` column is 100% empty, and there is no COGS / promo-calendar feed.
- Fit is a *trust floor*, never the objective. The goal is correct cut/keep/reinvest
  decisions that grow net revenue — not a big headline number.

Deeper reading: [`docs/`](docs/) (start at `docs/README.md` — business + technical layers,
plus the reference library), [`scripts/README.md`](scripts/README.md) (script catalogue),
[`output/DISCOUNT_PLAN/`](output/DISCOUNT_PLAN/) (the deliverables).
