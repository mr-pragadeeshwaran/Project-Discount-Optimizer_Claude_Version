"""
v4_config.py — Central configuration for Stat IQ Lab's 8-Stage Pricing
Optimization System.

Brand-agnostic by design: the client brand and platform are settings
(BRAND_NAME / PLATFORM_NAME below — current engagement: 24 Mantra Organic on
Blinkit), not facts baked into code. Competitor brands are excluded from
modeling; their pricing is captured via the Competitor Price column for
competitive positioning features.

EVERY VALUE BELOW IS A DEFAULT. Drop a settings file in config/ and it wins:

    config/settings.xlsx   (sheets: Settings | Festivals | Platform Events)
    config/settings.csv    (+ festivals.csv, platform_events.csv)

Get a pre-filled template from the dashboard (Inputs & Settings → Download
template) or run:  python -X utf8 scripts/make_settings_template.py

So a brand's targets, budget cap, hero SKUs, costs and festival calendar are
edited in a spreadsheet — not in this file. See settings_loader.py for the
registry of overridable keys and the (fail-loud) validation rules.
