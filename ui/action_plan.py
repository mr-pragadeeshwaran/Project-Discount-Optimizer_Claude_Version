"""
action_plan.py — the ONE master sheet: for every product x city, the single thing
to do and how much discount to set, in plain English.

The dashboard already surfaces the two "act now" slices (cut_list, reinvest_list).
This reconciles the decision engine's full verdict (plan/all_cells.csv, which buckets
EVERY cell in a confounder-aware way) with those two lists, so nothing is left
unexplained. Every cell resolves to exactly one of:

    Cut discount            trim a wasteful discount to its target      (bank the rupees)
    Reinvest — add discount discount reliably pays; room below break-even (grow volume)
    Hold — fix availability sales gated by stock, discount is not the lever
    Hold — defend share     losing category share; cutting may worsen it
    Monitor / test          no confident signal yet — watch, do not act

"How much to give" (disc_set) is therefore explicit for all cells:
    cut       -> tgt_disc   (down to the observed floor / break-even)
    reinvest  -> be_disc    (up toward the net-revenue-maximizing level)
    hold/mon  -> cur_disc   (no change — that IS the recommendation)

Faithful to scripts/analysis/discount_plan.py (bucketing + decision_reason) and
scripts/analysis/optimize_plan.py (the act-now reconciliation).
